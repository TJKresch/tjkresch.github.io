I have worked in a number of different capacities on many different software projects, as both a contractor and a stakeholder, so I understand multiple different perspectives when working on a team. I've worked for the past four years as an Independent Software Developer and New Venture Consultant.\r\n\r\n### Software Engineering\r\nAs a **Software Architect**, **Full-stack Web developer**, and **Entrepreneur**, I find that being comfortable in a wide variety of languages, frameworks, databases, tools, paradigms, architectures, and design patterns allows me to always have (if not The Right Toolâ„¢) at least an *appropriate* tool available for the job, even when tackling a type of problem I've never before encountered. \r\n\r\nTo that end, I make a dedicated effort to learn and use a diverse set of **tools, technologies, patterns, and paradigms**. And when a problem calls for more than one of them, even within the same category, I'm happy to oblige. Here are some of those that I use more frequently:\r\n\r\n#### Languages and Frameworks\r\n * **JavaScript**: `Node`, `React`, `Flux`, `Angular`, `Backbone`\r\n * Elixir: `Phoenix`\r\n * Ruby: `Rails`, `Sinatra`\r\n * HTML5: `Jade`, `Handlebars`, `Emmet`\r\n * CSS: `SCSS`, `SASS`\r\n * Python\r\n\r\n#### Databases\r\n * Relational and quasi-SQL DBs: `Postgres`, `MySQL`, `Cassandra`\r\n * Document and BigTable DBs: `MongoDB`, `CouchDB`, `HBase`\r\n * Cache and In-Memory DBs: `Redis`, `VoltDB`, `Couchbase`\r\n * Graph Databases: `Neo4j`\r\n\r\n#### Tools\r\n * Build Tools: `Grunt`, `Gulp`, `Webpack`, `Browserify`\r\n * Utilities: `Git`, `Github`, `SublimeGit`, `GitFLow`, `NPM`, `Bower`, `Homebrew`\r\n * Deploy Tools: `Amazon Web Services`, `Heroku`\r\n\r\n### Education\r\nI was born and raised in the US and graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a degree in Philosophy and Technology Management, focusing on New Venture Creation. I am self-educated, yet classically trained in Computer Science. As an early adopter of online \"MOOCs,\" I taught myself CS and software engineering by taking online courses from universities like MIT, UC Berkeley, Stanford, and Georgia Tech, through platforms like edX, Udacity, and Coursera.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n**Email:** [tyler@kresch.me](mailto:tyler@kresch.me)\r\n\r\n**Skype:** tyler.kresch\r\n\r\n**LinkedIn:** <https://linkedin.com/in/tylerkresch>",
